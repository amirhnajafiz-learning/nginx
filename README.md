# Gatsby-Blog

Creating a personal Blog using Gatsby.js and GraphQL

## Why Gatsby.js ?
<p>
Gatsby.js is a javascript base front-end framework that is super fast and very light. It is created
for static websites, and has no connections to database or server, hense it is fast. But it contains 
plugins and features that allows us to create dynamic websites too.
